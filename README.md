### Hi there 👋
- My current project is Flock XR 🐦, a 3D block-based editor using Blockly and Babylon.js. Currently in early access and running a pilot in schools. Lots more to do! [Flock XR code](https://github.com/flipcomputing/flock). [Flock XR demo](https://flipcomputing.github.io/flock/).
- I'm Co-Founder and CTO at [Flip Computing](https://flipcomputing.com) where we create inclusive technology education resources for children through to experienced professionals. 
- I'm currently taking the [Making Spaces Accreditation course](https://m4kingspaces.org/accreditation_course/) so that I can deliver training in the 3 Steps Towards Equitable Practice (3-STEP) approach ⚖️.
- We had lots of fun at [Flip Computing](http://flipcomputing.com) creating [UEFN and Verse](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/5JMO/fortnite-getting-started-with-uefn-free-resources) projects for the British Computer Society. We got an Innovate UK grant to create (Storytelling with music)[https://flipcomputing.com/storytelling-with-music/] on Fortnite. 
- I wrote 🐧[24 Days of Scratch Coding](https://flipcomputing.com/24-days-of-scratch/) book with my [Flip Computing](https://flipcomputing.com/) co-founders. 
- I'm currently learning 🪅UEFN/Verse and experimenting with 🐙[OctoStudio](https://www.techagekids.com/2023/10/octostudio-mobile-coding.html). 
- 🧪 I’ve experimented with [Scratch as a progressive web app](https://github.com/tracygardner/scratchpwa) and built a [Scratch project analyser](https://scratch-analysis.tracygardner.repl.co/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about progressive web apps (websites that can download to your phone or computer and run offline) and thinking about how technologies like ChatGPT will change the way we teach coding.  
- 👩🏿‍💻 I worked as Head of Technology at [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) and I'm passionate about getting more women and other under-estimated groups into tech careers - it's awesome and tech needs you!
- ✨ I worked for the Raspberry Pi Foundation for several years and wrote many [projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/paths) for Code Club and CoderDojo and led the creation of our [321 Make! methodogology and pedagogy](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/321-make-mentor-guide). 
- 📑 I was the lead author for [What do We Know about Computing Education for K-12 in Non-formal Settings? A Systematic Literature Review of Recent Research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3501385.3543960) which was accepted at ICER 2022. 
- 🐛 I wrote [micro:bit in Wonderland](https://Leanpub.com/microbitinwonderland/)
- 💡 I initiated and collaborated on [picozero](https://github.com/RaspberryPiFoundation/picozero) A beginner library for the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. 
- 👩‍🏫 I was the lead instructor for [Getting Started with Your Raspberry Pi](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/getting-started-with-your-raspberry-pi) on FutureLearn.
- 📕 My PhD thesis, [Inheritance Relationships for Disciplined Software Construction](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Inheritance-Relationships-Construction-Distinguished-Dissertations-ebook/dp/B000W2STRM) won a BCS Distinguished Dissertations award. 
- 📚 I co-wrote the [Miles Kelly Get Set Go Computing and ScratchJr](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=get+set+go+computing) books for young children.
- 🔍 I'm obsessed with search and metadata. I worked on collaborative projects including [DESIRE](http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/desire/) and [iMesh](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/december99/12dempsey.html) in the digital libraries space including [quality ratings in RDF](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/quality-ratings-in-rdf). I learned SEO and ran an internet marketing business.
- 🕸 I now neglect my website [TechAgeKids](https://www.techagekids.com/) which won a UK Blog Awards (Digital and Technology category) in 2017.
- ✔️ While working as a Software Architect at IBM I was a regular contributor at the OMG on [UML](https://issues.omg.org/issues/spec/UML/2.0?view=CLOSED) and [QVT](https://www.omg.org/spec/QVT/1.0/PDF) and regularly worked on model-driven architecture projects. 
- 🧵 I love making things with craft and tech. I like to use code to create SVG files that I can [render](https://github.com/tracygardner/layeredsvgcraft) online and then cut out on my Silhouette Cameo or a CNC cutter or laser cutter. I also like to create things to 3D print using BlocksCAD or OpenSCAD.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her, they is fine too.
- 📫 How to reach me: though GitHub or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracy-gardner-328406/)
- 💬 Ask me about why computing is a brilliant career.
- ⚡ Fun fact: In 2020 I got a long way through Advent of Code in Scratch! It was rather challenging and really showed me where the edges of Scratch are.
