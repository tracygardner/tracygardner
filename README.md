### Hi there 👋

- 🧪 I’m experimenting with [Scratch as a progressive web app](https://github.com/tracygardner/scratchpwa)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about progressive web apps (websites that can download to your phone or computer and run offline)
- ✨ I work for the Raspberry Pi Foundation and write [projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/paths) for Code Club and CoderDojo. 
- 📑 I was the lead author for [What do We Know about Computing Education for K-12 in Non-formal Settings? A Systematic Literature Review of Recent Research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3501385.3543960) which was accepted at ICER 2022. 
- 🐛 I wrote [micro:bit in Wonderland](https://Leanpub.com/microbitinwonderland/)
- 💡 I initiated and collaborated on [picozero](https://github.com/RaspberryPiFoundation/picozero) A beginner library for the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. 
- 👩‍🏫 I was the lead instructor for [Getting Started with Your Raspberry Pi](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/getting-started-with-your-raspberry-pi) on FutureLearn.
- 📕 My PhD thesis, [Inheritance Relationships for Disciplined Software Construction](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Inheritance-Relationships-Construction-Distinguished-Dissertations-ebook/dp/B000W2STRM) won a BCS Distinguished Dissertations award. 
- 📚 I co-wrote the [Miles Kelly Get Set Go Computing and ScratchJr](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=get+set+go+computing) books for young children.
- 🕸 I now neglect my website [TechAgeKids](https://www.techagekids.com/) which won a UK Blog Awards (Digital and Technology category) in 2017.
- 🧵 I love making things with craft and tech. I like to use code to create SVG files that I can [render](https://github.com/tracygardner/layeredsvgcraft) online and then cut out on my Silhouette Cameo or a CNC cutter or laser cutter. I also like to create things to 3D print using BlocksCAD or OpenSCAD.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her, they is fine too.
- 📫 How to reach me: though GitHub or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracy-gardner-328406/)
- 💬 Ask me about why computing is a brilliant career.
- ⚡ Fun fact: In 2020 I got a long way through Advent of Code in Scratch! It was rather challenging and really showed me where the edges of Scratch are.
